# The next two lines allow you to change the spacing in your thesis. You can 
# switch out \onehalfspacing with \singlespacing or \doublespacing, if desired.
header-includes:
    - \usepackage{setspace}
    - \onehalfspacing

# Remove the hashtag to specify which version of output you would like.
# Can only choose one at a time.
output:
  thesisdown::thesis_pdf: default 
#  thesisdown::thesis_gitbook: default         
#  thesisdown::thesis_word: default
#  thesisdown::thesis_epub: default

# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content 
# (e.g., abstract, acknowledgements) below or use code similar to line 25-26 
# for the .RMD files. If you are NOT producing a PDF, delete or silence
# lines 25-39 in this YAML header.
abstract: |
 I'm an abstract right here, look at me!
# If you'd rather include the preliminary content in files instead of inline
# like below, use a command like that for the abstract above.  Note that a tab 
# is needed on the line after the `|`.
acknowledgements: |
  I want to thank a few people.
dedication: |
  You can have a dedication here if you wish. 
preface: |
  This is an example of a thesis setup to use the reed thesis document class 
  (for LaTeX) and the R bookdown package, in general.
